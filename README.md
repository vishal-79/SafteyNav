SafetyNav ðŸš¦
SafetyNav is a React Native application built without Expo, designed to provide safer navigation routes by analyzing crime data and avoiding high-risk areas. This project is part of the GDSC Solutions Challenge 2025 by team Iconic 227.

Features
Crime Data Heatmap: Dynamically rendered heatmap based on crime data from the San Francisco Government API.

Safe Route Optimization: Calculates and visualizes the safest route between two points, avoiding high-crime areas.

Dynamic Search: Integrated search bars for Origin and Destination using Google Places Autocomplete.

User Location Rendering: Displays the user's real-time location on the map.

Responsive UI/UX: Enhanced visuals with animations, clean design, and seamless user interaction.

Dynamic Data Fetching: Fetches crime data based on the user's current location to provide localized safety analysis.

Route Safety Analysis: Compares route points against crime heatmap data and identifies risky segments.
